# failure_enthusiasts

Welcome everyone! 

Our code base lives here - session notes, setup files for projects, and projects themselves (later). We'll add a folder each week, to keep this central and easy to access.

**If this is your first time here, please navigate to our initial setup page and follow those instructions:**

Happy Failing!

# Ideas for Future Session Topics

### General Ideas for Future topics to cover
- Testing (Mocks, Unit Tests, Integration Tests, End-to-End Testing) [GeorgeSS]
- Test-driven Development
- Bitwise Operators and Bitmath [Clint]

### All the tech pieces for our Datadog mockup: 
Ideally we'll build one piece at a time, session by session. That week, we'll discuss the concept we're about to build first. I've added people that have expressed that they know how to do each given topic to possibly give that talk? No pressure,  just marking who's mentioned expertise in area - no one's on the hook to speak, yet :D

- Postgresql DB basic setup (Schema) [Zach Groves?]
- API Calls and Authentication (Bearer tokens, etc)
- Text Parsing (for API call response)
- Database Querying (SQL Connections) and Data Parsing
- Graphing the data we extract from our DB [Mike Carlos?]

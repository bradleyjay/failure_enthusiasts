# Python Basics, Enviornment Setup, and Guessing Game

## Session Notes
Week 1 - we covered basic Python syntax, and prepared to build a basic guessing game! 
- See [session_notes.md](https://github.com/bradleyjay/failure_enthusiasts/blob/master/1-basics_and_guessing_game/session_notes.md) for details

## Guessing Game

- A simple console program that accepts and evaluates user input

- The computer chooses a random number greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100

- The user will then guess numbers until they get the right one.

- After each guess, the computer will tell the user if the guess was too high, too low, or is correct.


### Sample Run Through
```
Comp:Iâ€™m thinking of a number between 1 and 100, can you guess it?

User: 50

Comp: Too high!

User:  25

Comp: Too Low!

User: 37

Comp:  You got it right!
```

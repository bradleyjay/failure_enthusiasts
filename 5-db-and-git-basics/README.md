### Github Basics

We'll start with this:
https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/

For today, we'll practice some basic git:
1. Clone a repo locally via `git clone <repo name>`
2. Create a branch with `git checkout -b <feature_name>`

3. Make our changes, working locally

4. Stage those changes by adding them to Index with `git add <filename>`, then commiting with `git commit -m '<some_descriptive_message_here'`

5. Push those changes to the remote repository on github via `git push origin <branch_name>`

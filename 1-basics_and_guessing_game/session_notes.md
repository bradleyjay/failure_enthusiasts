# Session Notes - Week 1 - Python Basics and Env Setup

Hi all! This week, we covered basic environment setup, and dove into some Python syntax. Also, new members! Welcome, Megan and Clint!

Here's a summary of our session this week:

### 1) Warmup
We worked through then discussed a Cracking the Coding Interview question (URL Parsing)

### 2) Set up our Environments
Our code base lives here - session notes, setup files for projects, and projects themselves later. I'll add a folder each week, to keep this central and easy to access:

We ran through this initial setup (Give this a try if you missed this week! We can help later)
https://github.com/bradleyjay/failure_enthusiasts/tree/master/python101-environment-setup
- Installed Python
- Created a Project folder
- Set up Virtual Enviroments

### 3) Then, Nate took us through Python Basics:
- High level Python info
- If-else Conditionals
- For Loops (plus Range() )
- Data Types and Casting
- Getting User Input
- Binary and Bitwise manipulation
- String Manipulation, built-in methods
- Functions: How to define and call them

### 4) Guessing Game
We got right up to starting to build a basic guessing game, bud didn't actually start. Give this a try in Python if you like, we can discuss next week!

Instructions here: (coming soon!)

# Next Week:
- We'll discuss the Guessing Game
- We'll jump into more Python basics - Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, and start talking about Classes
- We'll breaking into teams to work on a mini-project - paired programming, talking through code, and working together! This won't carry over week to week, so don't worry if you miss this one. We'll try new things each week - def keep coming back!

*Failure Enthusiasts - Week VI update - 5/22/19*

:duckwave: Hi team! :psyduck:

Happy Wednesday! This week, we’ll take the database setup we learned about last week, and look to combine that with our API call script to make a fully functioning backend! If you missed last week, no worries, we’re starting fresh - this week we’ll have two teams - *Database* and *API Call*.

We’ll have one team set up our database and CRUD operations, and the other get our API call Python script ready. Then we’ll put it together!

*Last week:*
- Covered github basics
- Worked through a basic Postgres install and setup
- Successfully wrote to our database

*This week:*
- We’ll discuss how each  team’s code should interface with the other
- Each team will build their half - either the database or API call script
- Finally, we’ll assemble them into a perfecting working, bug free piece of code. Easy as :cake: , right?

See you Thursday! 6:15 in Noho, per usual.
- Nate and Brad
